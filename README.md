# WaveOps

GPU-style waves for teams. Trade continuous meetings for discrete sync points and ship faster.

## Status

âœ… **Wave 1 COMPLETE** - Core foundation implemented
- Project Setup âœ…
- Schema Implementation âœ…  
- Core Data Models âœ…
- GitHub Integration Foundation âœ…

ðŸ”„ **Wave 2 IN PROGRESS** - Advanced coordination features
- Command Parser (pending)
- Validation Engine (pending) 
- Deployments Gate System (pending)
- Wave Gate Check System (pending)

## Quality Gates

This project now enforces:
- âœ… **Automated CI/CD** on all PRs
- âœ… **Node.js 18/20 matrix testing**
- âœ… **Zero-tolerance linting** (no `any` types allowed)
- âœ… **80% minimum test coverage**
- âœ… **Security audits**
- âœ… **Required code reviews**
- âœ… **Pre-commit hooks** (cannot bypass)

## Architecture

WaveOps uses GitHub as the single source of truth:
- **Issues** for tasks
- **Pull Requests** for implementation  
- **Deployments** for readiness gates
- **Check Runs** for wave completion
- **Issue Comments** for coordination commands

No meetings. No vibes. Just deterministic wave completion.

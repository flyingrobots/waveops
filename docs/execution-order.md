# WaveOps Implementation Execution Order

## Week 1: Core Foundation (Sequential + Parallel Tracks)

### Critical Path (Sequential)
1. **#1 Project Setup** → Must complete first
2. **#2 Schema Implementation** → Depends on #1
3. **#3 Core Data Models** → Depends on #1, #2

### Parallel Track A (After #1, #2 complete)
4. **#4 GitHub Integration Foundation** → Can start after #1, #2

### Integration Layer (After core + GitHub ready)
5. **#5 Command Parser** → Depends on #3, #4
6. **#6 Validation Engine** → Depends on #4 (can parallel with #5)

### Gateway Systems (After validation ready)
7. **#7 Deployments Gate System** → Depends on #6
8. **#8 Wave Gate Check System** → Depends on #3, #4, #7

### Final Assembly
9. **#9 GitHub Action Workflow** → Depends on #5, #6, #7, #8 (everything)

### Parallel Track B (Can start anytime after #1)
- **#15 Testing Framework** → Parallel development, incremental testing
- **#16 Documentation & Templates** → Parallel development

## Week 2: Advanced Features

### Prerequisites
All Week 1 core components (#1-9) must be complete and tested.

### Parallel Development (No strict order)
- **#10 Quorum System** → Extends #8 Wave Gate Check System
- **#11 Work Stealing** → Extends #5 Command Parser + #3 Core Data Models  
- **#12 Metrics Collection** → Extends #3 Core Data Models + new metrics engine
- **#17 Pilot Program** → Integration testing of all Week 1 + available Week 2 features

## Week 3: Optimization Features

### Prerequisites  
Week 1 complete + core Week 2 features operational.

### Advanced Extensions
- **#13 Speculative Execution** → Extends #5 Command Parser + #3 Core Data Models
- **#14 Rolling Frontier** → Extends #3 Core Data Models + dependency watching

## Dependency Graph Summary

```
#1 Project Setup (foundational)
├── #2 Schema Implementation
│   ├── #3 Core Data Models
│   └── #4 GitHub Integration Foundation
│       ├── #5 Command Parser (needs #3, #4)
│       ├── #6 Validation Engine (needs #4)
│       │   └── #7 Deployments Gate (needs #6)
│       │       └── #8 Wave Gate Check (needs #3, #4, #7)
│       │           └── #9 GitHub Action Workflow (needs #5, #6, #7, #8)
│       └── Parallel: #15 Testing, #16 Documentation

Week 2: #10, #11, #12, #17 (all depend on Week 1 complete)
Week 3: #13, #14 (depend on Week 1 + core Week 2)
```

## Critical Success Factors

1. **#1 Project Setup** must be rock solid - everything depends on it
2. **#4 GitHub Integration** is on critical path for all API interactions  
3. **#9 GitHub Action Workflow** is the integration point - needs all components working
4. **Testing (#15)** should run continuously, not just at the end
5. **Pilot Program (#17)** validates the entire system before broader rollout

## Parallel Work Opportunities

- **Schema + Core Models**: Can have 2 developers working simultaneously
- **GitHub Integration + Core Models**: Independent development paths  
- **Command Parser + Validation Engine**: Can develop in parallel once GitHub Integration is ready
- **Documentation + Testing**: Can happen throughout development
- **Week 2 Features**: Largely independent of each other

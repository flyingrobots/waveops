        ## ðŸŒŠ Wave Coordination
        
        This issue coordinates team readiness for a wave. Teams report completion by commenting `/ready wave-N` when all assigned tasks are complete.
        
        **Important:** Only team leads or authorized members should report readiness for their team.

        ## How Teams Report Readiness
        
        When your team completes **all** assigned tasks for this wave:
        
        ```
        /ready wave-[WAVE_NUMBER]
        ```
        
        **Requirements for readiness:**
        - âœ… All assigned tasks have merged PRs
        - âœ… All acceptance criteria are met
        - âœ… No blockers exist for other teams
        - âœ… Team lead approval obtained
        
        ## Wave Completion
        
        WaveOps will automatically complete this wave when:
        - All participating teams report readiness
        - All task validations pass
        - No blocking dependencies remain
        
        The wave will be marked complete with a GitHub Check Run and this issue will be closed.
